# Responsive Design

TenoxUI support responsive design by adding the breakpoints prefix to the elements.

## Usage

Adding breakpoint prefix to the element :

<Code
  lang="html"
  className="my-1rem" codeOnly>{`<div class="max-md:bg-red md:bg-blue lg:bg-green"></div>`}</Code>

## Important
If you want to use responsive design using tenoxui, you must define your classes like this :

<Code
  lang="html"
  className="my-1rem" codeOnly>{`<div class="bg-red max-md:bg-red md:bg-blue lg:bg-green"></div>`}</Code>

Breakdown :

- `bg-red` : initial style.
- `max-md:bg-red` : fallback for smaller than md.
- `md:bg-blue` : blue background on medium screen.

You need to know :

Since tenoxui using JavaScript for handling all of the styles, the responsive design is also handled by JavaScript. If you want to add the responsive breakpoint to your element, you `must` avoid this kind of class names :

<Code
  lang="html"
  className="my-1rem" codeOnly>{`<div class="bg-red md:bg-blue"></div>`}</Code>

It didn't know the styles that need to add below the medium screen. So, if you use that, the background will `stay` blue when your screen get smaller. Instead, use this :

<Code
  lang="html"
  className="my-1rem" codeOnly>{`<div class="bg-red max-md:bg-red md:bg-blue"></div>`}</Code>

Other tips, always add the breakpoint for smaller screen than tye breakpoint you use :

If the breakpoint started with `md` add `max-md:` with the same classname as initial style, in this case is `bg-red` :

<Code
  lang="html"
  className="my-1rem" codeOnly>{`<div class="bg-red max-md:bg-red md:bg-blue"></div>`}</Code>
  
It's same for other breakpoints, if you use `lg` for example :

<Code
  lang="html"
  className="my-1rem" codeOnly>{`<div class="bg-red max-lg:bg-red lg:bg-blue"></div>`}</Code>

We're sorry if it makes your class name more larger, but this is only handled full by JavaScript.

## Customizing Breakpoints

You can use <Link to="/docs/function/use">`use`</Link> function to customize your breakpoints. Example :

<Code
  lang="javascript"
  className="my-1rem" codeOnly>{`use({
  property: [...],
  breakpoint: [
    { name: "xxl", min: 1440 },
    { name: "xs", min: 0, max: 554 },
  ]
});`}</Code>

  nextIcon="wallpaper"
