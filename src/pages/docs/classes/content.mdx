TenoxUI CSS is a utility-first css framework that work using DOM to manipulate the styles into element by its classname, like d-flex, mt-10px, bg-#ccf654 and so on. So, it will slice the classname into two pieces, first is the type, and second is the value. TenoxUI will works like this :

<Tip variant="warning" title="you shouldn't do">
  Hello [`hello`](./s)
  
  <Code
  lang="javascript"
  className="mt-1rem"
  codeOnly
>{`var tenox = new makeTenoxUI({bg: "background"});`}</Code>
</Tip>

<Code
  lang="javascript"
  className="mt-1rem"
  codeOnly
>{`var tenox = new makeTenoxUI();`}</Code>
